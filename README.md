## Overview

**Generic Product Scraper** is a TypeScript-based scraping tool designed to extract and compare product prices from Latvian marketplaces such as **[kurpirkt.lv](https://kurpirkt.lv)** and **[salidzini.lv](https://salidzini.lv)**.

- Are cluttered with ads and unnecessary UI elements
- Make it difficult to quickly find the best deals

- **Cheerio** — Fast and lightweight HTML parsing
- **Ad-free** — No tracking, no ads
- **Free & Open Source** — Licensed for reuse and modification

## Usage

- Ensure that node, npm is installed;
- Ensure all dependencies are installed;
